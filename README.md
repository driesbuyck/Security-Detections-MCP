# Security Detections MCP

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets LLMs query a unified database of **Sigma**, **Splunk ESCU**, **Elastic**, and **KQL** security detection rules.

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=security-detections&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IiwiYXJncyI6WyIteSIsInNlY3VyaXR5LWRldGVjdGlvbnMtbWNwIl0sImVudiI6eyJTSUdNQV9QQVRIUyI6Ii9wYXRoL3RvL3NpZ21hL3J1bGVzLC9wYXRoL3RvL3NpZ21hL3J1bGVzLXRocmVhdC1odW50aW5nIiwiU1BMVU5LX1BBVEhTIjoiL3BhdGgvdG8vc2VjdXJpdHlfY29udGVudC9kZXRlY3Rpb25zIiwiU1RPUllfUEFUSFMiOiIvcGF0aC90by9zZWN1cml0eV9jb250ZW50L3N0b3JpZXMiLCJFTEFTVElDX1BBVEhTIjoiL3BhdGgvdG8vZGV0ZWN0aW9uLXJ1bGVzL3J1bGVzIiwiS1FMX1BBVEhTIjoiL3BhdGgvdG8va3FsLXJ1bGVzIn19)

## 🆕 MCP Prompts - Expert Detection Workflows

This server includes **11 pre-built MCP Prompts** that provide structured, expert-level workflows for common security detection tasks. Instead of figuring out which tools to use and in what order, just ask for a prompt by name and get a comprehensive, professional analysis.

### How to Use Prompts in Cursor

Simply ask Claude to use a prompt by name:

```
You: "Use the ransomware-readiness-assessment prompt"
You: "Run apt-threat-emulation for APT29"  
You: "Execute the executive-security-briefing prompt for our CISO"
You: "Use detection-engineering-sprint with capacity 5 and focus on ransomware"
```

### Available Prompts

| Prompt | Description | Arguments |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `ransomware-readiness-assessment` | Comprehensive kill-chain analysis with risk scoring and remediation roadmap | `priority_focus`: prevention/detection/response/all |
| `apt-threat-emulation` | Assess coverage against specific threat actors (APT29, Lazarus, Volt Typhoon, etc.) | `threat_actor` (required), `include_test_plan` |
| `purple-team-exercise` | Generate complete test plans with procedures and expected detections | `scope` (tactic or technique), `environment` |
| `soc-investigation-assist` | Investigation helper with triage guidance, hunting queries, and escalation criteria | `indicator` (required), `context` |
| `detection-engineering-sprint` | Prioritized detection backlog with user stories and acceptance criteria | `sprint_capacity`, `threat_focus` |
| `executive-security-briefing` | C-level report with business risk language and investment recommendations | `audience`: board/ciso/cto, `include_benchmarks` |
| `cve-response-assessment` | Rapid assessment for emerging CVEs and threats | `cve_or_threat` (required) |
| `data-source-gap-analysis` | Analyze telemetry requirements for improved detection coverage | `target_coverage` |
| `detection-quality-review` | Deep-dive quality analysis of detections for a specific technique | `technique_id` (required) |
| `threat-landscape-sync` | Align detection priorities with current threat landscape | `industry` |
| `detection-coverage-diff` | Compare coverage against threat actors or baseline | `compare_against` (required) |

### Example: Ransomware Assessment

```
You: "Use the ransomware-readiness-assessment prompt"

Claude will automatically:
1. Get baseline stats with get_stats
2. Analyze ransomware-specific gaps with identify_gaps
3. Review coverage by tactic with analyze_coverage  
4. Map gaps to the ransomware kill chain
5. Generate prioritized remediation roadmap
6. Output a professional report with risk scores
```

### Example: APT Threat Assessment

```
You: "Run apt-threat-emulation for Volt Typhoon"

Claude will:
1. Research Volt Typhoon using MITRE ATT&CK data
2. Get all 81 techniques attributed to the group
3. Check your detection coverage for each technique
4. Calculate coverage percentage and identify blind spots
5. Generate a purple team test plan (optional)
6. Provide prioritized detection recommendations
```

## Getting Detection Content

### Quick Start: Download All Rules (Copy & Paste)

Create a `detections` folder and download all sources with sparse checkout (only downloads the rules, not full repos):

```bash
# Create detections directory
mkdir -p detections && cd detections

# Download Sigma rules (~3,000+ rules)
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma.git
cd sigma && git sparse-checkout set rules rules-threat-hunting && cd ..

# Download Splunk ESCU detections + stories (~2,000+ detections, ~330 stories)
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/splunk/security_content.git
cd security_content && git sparse-checkout set detections stories && cd ..

# Download Elastic detection rules (~1,500+ rules)
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules.git
cd detection-rules && git sparse-checkout set rules && cd ..

# Download KQL hunting queries (~400+ queries from 2 repos)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Hunting-Queries-Detection-Rules.git kql-bertjanp
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/jkerai1/KQL-Queries.git kql-jkerai1

echo "Done! Configure your MCP with these paths:"
echo "  SIGMA_PATHS: $(pwd)/sigma/rules,$(pwd)/sigma/rules-threat-hunting"
echo "  SPLUNK_PATHS: $(pwd)/security_content/detections"
echo "  ELASTIC_PATHS: $(pwd)/detection-rules/rules"
echo "  KQL_PATHS: $(pwd)/kql-bertjanp,$(pwd)/kql-jkerai1"
echo "  STORY_PATHS: $(pwd)/security_content/stories"
```

### Alternative: Full Clone

If you prefer full git history:

```bash
# Sigma Rules
git clone https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma.git
# Use rules/ and rules-threat-hunting/ directories

# Splunk ESCU
git clone https://github.com/splunk/security_content.git
# Use detections/ and stories/ directories

# Elastic Detection Rules
git clone https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules.git
# Use rules/ directory

# KQL Hunting Queries (multiple sources supported)
git clone https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Hunting-Queries-Detection-Rules.git
git clone https://github.com/jkerai1/KQL-Queries.git
# Use entire repos, combine paths with comma
```

## 🆕 MCP Resources - Readable Context

MCP Resources let LLMs read context directly without tool calls. Perfect for understanding the current state before making decisions.

### Available Resources

| Resource URI | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `detection://stats` | Current inventory statistics |
| `detection://coverage-summary` | Tactic-by-tactic coverage percentages |
| `detection://gaps/ransomware` | Current ransomware detection gaps |
| `detection://gaps/apt` | Current APT detection gaps |
| `detection://top-techniques` | Top 20 techniques with most coverage |

Resources are automatically available in Cursor's context when needed.

## 🆕 Argument Completions

The server provides **autocomplete suggestions** as you type argument values:

| Argument | Completions From |
|----------|-----------------|
| `technique_id` | Your indexed MITRE technique IDs (T1059.001, etc.) |
| `cve_id` | Your indexed CVE IDs (CVE-2024-27198, etc.) |
| `process_name` | Process names in your detections (powershell.exe, etc.) |
| `tactic` | All 14 MITRE tactics |
| `severity` | informational, low, medium, high, critical |
| `source_type` | sigma, splunk_escu, elastic, kql |
| `threat_profile` | ransomware, apt, initial-access, persistence, etc. |

This prevents typos and helps discover what values are available in your detection corpus.

## 🆕 Structured Errors & Suggestions

When errors occur or no results are found, the server returns **helpful JSON responses** instead of plain strings:

```json
// Missing required argument
{
  "error": true,
  "code": "MISSING_REQUIRED_ARG",
  "message": "technique_id is required",
  "examples": ["T1059.001", "T1547.001", "T1003.001"],
  "hint": "Use format T####.### (e.g., T1059.001 for PowerShell)"
}

// No results found
{
  "results": [],
  "technique_id": "T1234.999",
  "suggestions": {
    "message": "No detections found for this technique",
    "similar_techniques": ["T1234.001", "T1234.002"],
    "try_search": "search(\"T1234\") for broader results",
    "tip": "Parent techniques (T1234) may catch sub-techniques"
  }
}
```

This helps LLMs self-correct and suggest alternatives without getting stuck.

## Claude Code Skills

This repo includes [Claude Code Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) in `.claude/skills/` that teach Claude efficient workflows:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `coverage-analysis` | Efficient coverage analysis using the token-optimized tools |

**Why skills?** Instead of figuring out methodology each time (wasting tokens), skills teach Claude once.

You can also install personal skills to `~/.claude/skills/` for cross-project use.

### Example: Efficient Coverage Analysis

```
You: "What's my Elastic coverage against ransomware?"

AI uses skills + efficient tools:
1. analyze_coverage(source_type="elastic")     → Stats by tactic
2. identify_gaps(threat_profile="ransomware")  → Prioritized gaps
3. suggest_detections(technique_id="T1486")    → Fix top gap

Total: ~5KB of data vs ~500KB with traditional tools
```

## When to Use Which Search Tool

**Use `search(query)`** when:
- You want to search across ALL detection sources (Sigma, Splunk, Elastic, KQL)
- You're doing broad research without caring about the source repository
- Example: "Find all detections mentioning CVE-2024-27198"

**Use `list_by_source_path(path_pattern)`** when:
- You want ALL detections from a specific repository or directory
- You're exploring what's available in a particular source
- Example: "Show me all rules from my personal repo"
- ⚠️ Warning: Can return large result sets (100+ detections)

**Use `search_by_source_path(query, path_pattern)`** when:
- You want targeted search within a specific repository or directory
- You're comparing detection coverage between different sources
- You want to reduce noise from irrelevant repositories
- Example: "Find powershell detections in your own rules only"
- Example: "Search for lateral movement techniques in threat-hunting rules"
- ✅ Recommended for most repository-specific queries (more efficient than `list_by_source_path`)

**Examples:**

```python
# Broad search - all sources
search("T1059.001")

# All rules from jkerai1's repo (potentially 420+ results!)
list_by_source_path("jkerai1")

# Targeted search - powershell in jkerai1's repo only (5-10 results)
search_by_source_path("powershell", "jkerai1")

# Compare your own vs public Sigma for a technique
search_by_source_path("T1003.001", "your-repo")
search_by_source_path("T1003.001", "SigmaHQ/sigma")

# Find CVEs in threat-hunting rules specifically
search_by_source_path("CVE-2024", "rules-threat-hunting")
```

## Example Workflows

### Using MCP Prompts (Recommended for Complex Tasks)

```
# Comprehensive ransomware assessment
You: "Use the ransomware-readiness-assessment prompt"
→ Full kill-chain analysis with risk scoring and remediation roadmap

# Assess coverage against a specific APT
You: "Run apt-threat-emulation for Volt Typhoon"
→ Technique-by-technique coverage analysis with test plan

# Generate a sprint backlog
You: "Use detection-engineering-sprint with capacity 5 focusing on apt threats"
→ Prioritized user stories with acceptance criteria

# Executive reporting
You: "Run executive-security-briefing for the board"
→ Business-risk language with investment recommendations
```

## Database

The index is stored at `~/.cache/security-detections-mcp/detections.sqlite`.

- Auto-created on first run
- Auto-indexed when paths are configured
- Use `rebuild_index()` to refresh after updating detection repos

## Supported Detection Formats

### Sigma Rules (YAML)

Based on the [official Sigma specification](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-specification):
- All required fields: `title`, `logsource`, `detection`
- All optional fields: `id`, `status`, `description`, `author`, `date`, `modified`, `references`, `tags`, `level`, `falsepositives`, etc.
- CVE tags extracted from `tags` field (e.g., `cve.2021-1675`)

### Splunk ESCU (YAML)

From [Splunk Security Content](https://github.com/splunk/security_content):
- Required: `name`, `id`, `search`
- Optional: `description`, `author`, `date`, `status`, `references`, `tags` (including `mitre_attack_id`, `analytic_story`, `cve`)

### Splunk Analytic Stories (YAML - Optional)

From [Splunk Security Content stories](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/tree/develop/stories):
- Provides rich narrative context for threat campaigns
- Enhances semantic search with detailed descriptions
- Links detections to broader threat context

### Elastic Detection Rules (TOML)

From [Elastic Detection Rules](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules):
- Required: `rule.name`, `rule.rule_id`
- Optional: `rule.description`, `rule.query`, `rule.severity`, `rule.tags`, `rule.threat` (MITRE mappings)
- Supports EQL, KQL, Lucene, and ESQL query languages

### KQL Hunting Queries (Markdown & Raw .kql)

Supports multiple KQL repositories:

**[Bert-JanP/Hunting-Queries-Detection-Rules](https://github.com/Bert-JanP/Hunting-Queries-Detection-Rules)** (~290 queries)
- Microsoft Defender XDR and Azure Sentinel hunting queries in Markdown format
- Extracts title from markdown heading, KQL from fenced code blocks
- Extracts MITRE technique IDs from tables
- Categories: Defender For Endpoint, Azure AD, Threat Hunting, DFIR, etc.

**[jkerai1/KQL-Queries](https://github.com/jkerai1/KQL-Queries)** (~130 queries)
- Raw `.kql` files for Defender, Entra, Azure, Office 365
- Title derived from filename
- Lightweight queries for kqlsearch.com

## 🔗 Using with MITRE ATT&CK MCP

**This MCP pairs perfectly with [mitre-attack-mcp](https://github.com/MHaggis/mitre-attack-mcp)** for complete threat coverage analysis:

| MCP | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **security-detections-mcp** | Query 7,200+ detection rules + 11 expert workflow prompts |
| **mitre-attack-mcp** | ATT&CK framework data, threat groups, Navigator layers |

### With MCP Prompts (Easiest)

The prompts automatically leverage both MCPs for comprehensive analysis:

```
You: "Run apt-threat-emulation for APT29"

The prompt automatically:
1. Uses mitre-attack-mcp to get APT29's profile and techniques
2. Uses security-detections-mcp to check coverage for each technique
3. Calculates coverage percentage and identifies gaps
4. Generates purple team test plan
5. Outputs professional report with recommendations
```

```
You: "Use threat-landscape-sync for the finance industry"

The prompt automatically:
1. Gets top threat actors from mitre-attack-mcp
2. Filters by industry relevance
3. Analyzes your coverage against each actor
4. Prioritizes detection investments
5. Creates strategic roadmap
```

### With Tools Directly (More Control)

```
You: "What's my coverage against APT29?"

LLM workflow (3 calls, ~10KB total):
1. mitre-attack-mcp → get_group_techniques("G0016")     # APT29's TTPs
2. detections-mcp → analyze_coverage(source_type="elastic")  # Your coverage
3. mitre-attack-mcp → find_group_gaps("G0016", your_coverage) # The gaps

Result: Prioritized gap list, not 500KB of raw data
```

### Generate Navigator Layer

```
You: "Generate a Navigator layer for my initial access coverage"

LLM workflow:
1. detections-mcp → get_technique_ids(tactic="initial-access")  # Get covered technique IDs
2. mitre-attack-mcp → generate_coverage_layer(covered_ids, "Initial Access Coverage")

→ Returns ready-to-import Navigator JSON
```

### Install Both Together (Recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "security-detections": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "security-detections-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "SIGMA_PATHS": "/path/to/sigma/rules",
        "SPLUNK_PATHS": "/path/to/security_content/detections",
        "ELASTIC_PATHS": "/path/to/detection-rules/rules",
        "KQL_PATHS": "/path/to/kql-hunting-queries"
      }
    },
    "mitre-attack": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mitre-attack-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ATTACK_DOMAIN": "enterprise-attack"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
